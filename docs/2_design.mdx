# Design your LeXscroW

A LeXscroW user must first determine which of the three LeXscroW types is proper for their intended use, and whether to codify a condition or multiple conditions to the execution of such LeXscroW.

## LeXscroW Types

`DoubleTokenLexscrow`: escrowed swap of two different non-fee-on-transfer, non-rebasing ERC20 tokens

`TokenLexscrow`: escrowed transfer of non-fee-on-transfer, non-rebasing ERC20 tokens

`EthLexscrow`: escrowed transfer of native gas tokens


All LeXscroW types have the following features:

- Ownerless unique contract deployment
- Optional immutable conditions for execution, including signatures, time, oracle-fed data, and more
- Specified part(ies), or allow any address to become a counterparty
- Ability for parties to replace their own address; may be an EOA or a contract
- Option for mutual early termination 
- Expiration time denominated in Unix time
- Re-usability until expiration

## Conditions 

**All condition contracts upon which a LeXscroW is intended to be contingent must be deployed BEFORE the LeXscroW itself.**

Condition structs have the following syntax:
``` solidity
    enum Logic {
        AND,
        OR
    }

    struct Condition {
        address condition;
        Logic op;
    }
```
`condition` is the contract address of the elected condition contract. MetaLeX has several condition contract types [available in the borg-core repository](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/borg-core/tree/main/src/libs/conditions), which are fully compatible with LeXscroW. Users may also elect to use their own custom condition contracts. 

All condition contracts MUST have a `checkCondition` function which conforms to the following interface:
``` solidity
    interface ICondition {
        function checkCondition(
            address _contract,
            bytes4 _functionSignature,
            bytes memory data
        ) external view returns (bool);
    }
```
The `Logic` struct member determines whether the given `Condition` or any other `Condition` must be satisfied in order for the LeXscroW to execute (`OR`); or alternatively if the given `Condition` must be satisfied (`AND`) for the LeXscroW to execute

Once deployed, conditions are not exclusive to a given LeXscroW (`checkConditions()` has no access control), so different LeXscroWs may share a `LexscrowConditionManager` or individual `condition` if so desired. Users must exercise extreme caution in using third party-deployed conditions.

The conditions are passed either:

1. *via factory deployment*, as an array of `Condition` structs in the applicable LeXscroW factory contract's deploy function which will deploy a [LexscrowConditionManager](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/LeXscrow/blob/main/src/libs/LexscrowConditionManager.sol) accordingly, or 
2. *via direct LeXscroW constructor*, by first deploying a `LexscrowConditionManager.sol` contract supplying the array of `Condition` structs, and supplying the `LexscrowConditionManager` contract address to the LeXscroW's constructor.

In both methods, the `LexscrowConditionManager`'s conditions are supplied as an array of `condition` structs to its constructor and are immutable; therefore once the LeXscroW has been deployed, the conditions to its execution are immutable.

### LexscrowConditionManager

LexscrowConditionManager is an immutable contract to implement an arbitrary amount and combination of conditions to execution for LeXscroWs, with a public `checkConditions()` function designed to be called by a LeXscroW's `execute()` function and return a boolean result of condition(s) satisfaction as described below. 

LeXscroW's LexscrowConditionManager is a stripped-down version of the [BORG-CORE ConditionManager](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/BORG-CORE/blob/main/src/libs/conditions/conditionManager.sol), removing auth/access control (and thus also the ability to add or remove conditions post-deployment) in favor of immutability. The BORG-CORE ConditionManager may also be compatible for use with LeXscroWs, but users should exercise care in integrating bespoke condition managers and those that do not carry the same level of immutability as LexscrowConditionManager.

#### checkConditions()

Iterates through the `conditions` array, calling each `condition` contract's `checkCondition()` function.

| Param  | Type | Description 
| :---:  |:----:|  :---: |
| `data` | bytes | optional param for any data passed to the condition contracts |

Returns `result` boolean of whether the necessary combination of conditions (if applicable, accounting for each Condition's `Logic` operator) have been satisfied.
